#allsongsmap Readme

## About

This is allsongsmap, a webapp that combines the NPR Story API with the Songkick API to figure out if artists featured on the [All Songs Considered](http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/) podcast have upcoming shows in a certain area. The vision is to come to this site, type in your zip code/ city, hit a big 'ol button and get back a list of upcoming events with links to their Songkick page so you can get tickets. Also being explored are sorting featured artists by genre and date, as well as creating a feed so you could just import this whole list right into songkick and have them send you update emails. Rock on! \o/
